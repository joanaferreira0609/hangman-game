# hangman-game
First project - Ruby

This file represents a class for the Hangman game.

The program provides the user with a hint for the secret word and display spaces to indicate the number of letters in the secret word.

The user has 6 lives. 

When the user guesses the correct letter, the program reveals the chosen letter in its correct position within the word. 

If the user guesses the letter incorrectly, the program shows the message "The letter doesn't exist!" and decreases one life.

The program ends when the user guesses the word or loses all 6 lives.
